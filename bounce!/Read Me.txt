about:

I've been learning python from a book and thought it would be a good idea to test
what I know so far. So I made this game. It was made in python2.7 and was created
using pygame and livewires packages. The aim is to simply keep the ball from
touching the floor.

controls:

a - moves left

d - moves right

esc - exit

programs and additional software used:

python 2.7

paint.net

pygame

livewires package
